## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).   

## How Can I Contribute?
This section guides you through how to contribute as a internal or external partner. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.  
Contributions and bug reports are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue [Here](https://github.com/kashish1928/dsci-310-group-02/issues).  

If you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible: 

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.  
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.   
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).  
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.  
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**  
* **Include details about your configuration and environment**  

#### Internal contributors  
* Use issues to list and assgin the tasks that need accomplishment, and issues should be linkled to project milestone.
* Pull at the beginning of each work session, and **commit(messages should be meaningful)** and push at the end.
* Follow the [GitHub flow workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), which means creating branches for each feature or fix, and they should be reviewed by at least one other teammate.  

#### External contributors  
* External contributors need open issues first to explain how they'd like to help.  
* Once accepted, they should fork the repo and submit a pull request. All contribution must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
